The full Nao Detector can run a set of different commands to execute different tasks. You can list the options with -h.
The available options are:
-train = "Train a fHOG detector SVM with given training and testing XML."
-test = "Test an already trained fHOG detector on testing XML."
-track = "Track detected (or selected) objects in a videostream."
-cross = "Execute cross-validation evaluation on dataset."
-ball = "Train ball specific fHOG with cross-validation and parameter optimization"
-eval = "Bulk evaluate already existing fHOGs."
-pose = "Run a set of pose detectors on a given set of images."
-visualize = "Shows extra images and visualizations while running through one program, e.g. for -cross every image splitted by folds is shown."
-video = "Tries to process input images as fast as possible, can be used to scan through a video"
-threshold = "Use incremental threshold values to evaluate learned detector during test or evaluation phase."
-nnr = "Use a nuclear norm regularizer for detector training."
-classic = "Use a classic HOG detector with one single filter."
-e = "Set trainings epsilon as acceptance criteria  0.1 to 0.01 should be plenty accurate.", 1 // takes 1 argument
-c = "Set trainings C for SVM accepted values are 0.000001 to 1000000, default is 1, higher value of C encourages overfitting to the trainings data", 1
-h = "Shows available command line options."
-in = "This option can be used run a pre-defined training/test, option requires one parameter, e.g. TEST1, TRAINING1", 1

Further a lot of the arguments are specified in the HOGconfig.txt file. Make sure the listed directory in that file point to the correct data sets and detectors.
You can than easily run a pre-set experiment by referring to the given tag, for example:
fHOG_FullNaoDetector.exe --eval --classic --in Evaluation1 
	= to run a batch evaluation of a set of .svm detectors 
fHOG_FullNaoDetector.exe --pose --in Pose1
	= to run a pose detection experiment based on classificators named Standing.svm, Sitting.svm, Lying.svm, Goalie.svm
fHOG_FullNaoDetector.exe --test --threshold --in Test2
	= to evaluate a single .svm for different acceptance thresholds
fHOG_FullNaoDetector.exe --test --classic --in Test9
	= to reduce an fHOG before evaluation
fHOG_FullNaoDetector.exe --cross --nnr
	= to train and cross-validate a number of nnr fHOG detectors for a set range of epsilon and c_values
